This dataset contains the handwitten digits and in this particular notebook we try to visualize different digits through different colors. 

The handwitten digit is written in the a matrix of 28x28 which  comes out to be 784 cells. 

Each cell if is represented by 1 means that it is colored and if its 0 then it is black. The combination of 1's determine the digit in the cell.

Here , using this dataset we are visualizing 2d and plot the number of digits in the dataset.
