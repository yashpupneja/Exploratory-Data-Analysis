In this we have shown the simple implementation of KNN and viualized it using several datasets which include:
1. Overlap
2. Ushape
3. Concentric circle1
4. Concentric Circle2
5. Outlier
6. Xor
7. Twospirals
8. Random

Through these datasets using different nearest neighbors that is K we get to know how the underfitting and overfitting can occur and what are the correct or accurate sets.
The future predictions may be incorrect as we can see in the two spirals that the further if point is negative it would classified as positive due to the nearest neighbors which would show that not all times we can use KNN.
